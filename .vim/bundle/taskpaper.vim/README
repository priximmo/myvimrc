From the TaskPaper website (http://hogbaysoftware.com/projects/taskpaper):

  "TaskPaper is a simple to-do list application that helps you stay
organized. Unlike competing applications, TaskPaper is based on plain text
files which offer you paper-like simplicity and ease of use." 

TaskPaper is a to-do list application for Mac OS X based on the "Getting
Things Done" approach of David Allen (http://www.davidco.com/). It supports
the GTD notions of projects, tasks and contexts.

This package contains a syntax file and a file-type plugin for the simple
format used by the TaskPaper application. It is intended for Mac users who
want to edit their TaskPaper lists in Vim from time to time (for example, in
a SSH session, or on a non-Mac system) and for anyone who is looking for a
simple to-do list format.
